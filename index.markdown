I am a PhD candidate in Genetics Department at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be mentored by [Alistair Boettiger](https://boettigerlab.stanford.edu). Broadly, I am interested in chromatin structures in various contexts. Specifically, I am interested in how chromatin structures change as a function of cell cycle, how loop extrusion proteins affect mitotic condensation process, and how the nuclear environment affects the architecture of interphase chromatin.

Since Summer 2024, as a guest researcher at Flatiron Institute, I have been working closely with [Pilar Cossio](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/pilar-cossio/) to develop a computational tool to describe high-dimensional heterogeneity of chromatin structures inspired by statistical mechanics, Bayesian inference, and information theory. 

Before Stanford, I received a bachelor's degree in [Computer Science and Molecular Biology](https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-molecular-biology-course-6-7/) from MIT. As an undergraduate researcher, I studied [the non-Markovian property of cell state transitions in mouse embryonic stem cells](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00847-6) with [Salil Garg](https://www.garglab.org). 

In my free time, you can find me catching up with *The New Yorker*, listening to [Brahms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p73MD6QHpIQ), and playing pickleball.

You can contact me at teeu (at) stanford (dot) edu.
