    I am a PhD candidate in Genetics Department at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be mentored by [Alistair Boettiger](https://boettigerlab.stanford.edu). Broadly, I am interested in chromatin structures in various contexts.
    Specifically, I am interested in...  
    1. The changes in chromatin structures as a function of cell cycle and how loop extrusion proteins affect chromatin folding process. 
    2. Using molecular dynamics simulation to study the effects of cohesins and friends on interphase chromatin structures. 
   
    Since Summer 2024, as a guest researcher at Flatiron Institute, I have been working closely with [Pilar Cossio](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/pilar-cossio/) to develop a computational tool to describe high-dimensional heterogeneity of chromatin structures inspired by statistical mechanics, Bayesian inference, and information theory. 

    Before Stanford, I received a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Molecular Biology from MIT. As an undergraduate researcher, I studied [the non-Markovian property of cell state transitions in mouse embryonic stem cells](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00847-6) with [Salil Garg](https://www.garglab.org). 

    In my free time, you can find me catching up with *The New Yorker*, listening to Brahms, and playing pickleball.
